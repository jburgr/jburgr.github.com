        <h3> Hi there</h3>

<p>I'm an engineer-turned-Product Designer. Currently, I am a design researcher at PathAI, working on their suite of clinical products. Previously I have worked as a product designer at DrugDev on their LMS to ensure clinical trials' staff are fully trained and compliant. Prior to that, I lived in the Netherlands as a Fulbright Scholar, where I took courses at TU Delft to increase my knowledge of the Dutch Design methodologies. Before that, I worked as a senior user experience design associate at athenahealth. I received my B.S. in Engineering with a Concentration in Biomechanics from Olin College of Engineering in 2014.</p>

        <p>Curious about what led me to Olin? I love to write, and blogged for the Olinsider during my time at Olin. Check out some of my <a href = "http://www.olin.edu/blog/the-olinsider/post/deposit-slips-apple-crisp-and-relativity/">posts</a></p>
